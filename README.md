<h1>About Me! üòé</h1>

### As a front-end developer and graphic designer with over two years of experience, I bring a unique blend of technical and creative skills to the table. My passion for web design and development, combined with my background in computer science (BSc in CSE), has given me a strong foundation in the industry and an eye for detail.

I am confident in my ability to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various front-end frameworks and have a strong understanding of responsive design and cross-browser compatibility.

I am now seeking an internship as a front-end developer to further develop my skills and gain hands-on experience in a professional environment. I am eager to work with a team of experienced developers and designers and contribute to the creation of innovative and impactful web projects.
